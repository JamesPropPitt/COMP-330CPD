# Introduction
While I am still unsure what path I wish to go down in terms of my career path, I have learned from doing this course that I no longer wish to pursue a career in programming or anything related to coding and computing. However this has still been a very useful learning experience; I have learned to co-operate in a team effectively, as well as come out of my comfort zone and throw myself into situations which require me to perform under stress. I have also learned how to properly manage myself in terms of time and how to deliver an assignment on time. 
Some of the goals I had set myself in the previous Continued Personal Development report I have achieved, while two I am still focusing on achieving, these are listed and explained below.
# SMART

### Willpower
I have a tendency, as most people do, to play video games rather than get work done. I have gotten into the habit of becoming very good at procrastination techniques, so I sort out a time to get work done which gives me time to play games now but when the planned time comes I just move it back to another time, repeat. To combat this, I have decided to flip work and games around. Instead of negotiating when I do work, I will now negotiate when I play games. I hope this changes my mindset towards working and helps eliminate my tendency to simply keep pushing work back until it's too late. This is a key skill which has been carried over from the previous term, albeit my willpower has improved and my ability to force myself to work and complete tasks has largely been a success, there is still much to improve upon. I intend to locate a Pomodoro timer to better aid my concentration on tasks. This helps, as I am able to tell myself that I need only work for 15 minutes and then I can take a break, alleviating the stress and breaking work up into small bite-size steps.

### Reading
Due to the nature of a dissertation requiring oneself to be sufficiently learned in various topics and have awareness of papers relating to the theme of the dissertation; I have been reading a fair amount. I wish to continue this trend of reading and carry it over to, potentially, fictional books too. My goal is to visit the university library and take out a book every three weeks for the rest of my time at the university and read it completely in that time. I feel this is an appropriate and realistic goal since I have not been an avid reader in the past, therefore a medium sized book every three weeks should suffice. I will reflect on my progress at the end of July and write a report about how many books I have read and the level of my comprehension towards those books. 

### Anxiety
First and foremost on this list, and first and foremost theme of my life. I don't intend to completely eradicate this emotion, but my goal is to learn better coping mechanisms so that I don't have to take a fortnight out of my academic year to calm down. Expanding on this, I have been doing some psycho-dynamic therapy recently which is expected to span for the rest of my university life. Although I have found the quintessential medication for myself and have been fairly stable the last term, I have struggled with concentration as my medication tends to block any and all thought. This is a preferred symptom over anxiety but an equally disruptive one, I will be pursuing concentration techniques with my student mentor Charlotte.

### Personal Health
I have been sleeping in irregular patterns, sometimes too much and sometimes too little. I need to see a doctor about my sleeping pills and sort out setting an alarm to wake up at more appropriate times. This will be done, hopefully by the beginning of March. The lack of, or excess, of sleep should be fairly self-explanatory as to the detriment of my work life and team contributions.
An example of how I plan to tackle this is to set alarms to wake up at 8AM and then go to sleep no later than 10PM, with exercise to keep my mind stimulated throughout the day and metabolism high. 
I need to create a routine where I am forced to expose myself to exercising more to keep myself fit and my mind active. I can do this by making sure that I exercise at least 1 hour a day everyday at the start of the day. This will be done starting immediately and will be carried on forever (hopefully). Exercise has shown by numerous studies to be particularly useful in stimulating the brain, as well as being beneficial for overall health. With this in mind, this should help alleviate the lack of willpower I have been experiencing as well. 

### Writing
Recently I have decided to start using a journal to write as much information as possible down. This can be in the form of deadlines, calendar reminders and other thoughts which strike me as important and necessary at the time. I intend to input a personal entry into this journal on a weekly basis which reflects on my positive outcomes, as well as how I could have lessened any negative outcomes of the week. This will be done over the rest of my time at university, after which I will analyse whether or not I have been more productive as a result of the journal, or if the journal has been redundant. 


### What's next?
With these 5 skills improved upon, I expect to see myself more active and engaged when working in a team or accomplishing activities by myself. The Willpower and anxiety have been previous smart goals which I have failed to meet, but I have included them in this report since they are still relevant and still require tackling. Since the previous methods did not provide the intended outcome, I have changed how I intend to tackle these two key skills in hopes that the outcome this time will be more fortuitous. With the help of the university I will have achieved my goals I have set for myself by the end of July and I will be setting out into the world with a better state of mind and better character skills. When entering a job I will intend to keep up progress reports, in the form fo CPD reports, which I have learnt how to do during my time on this course. Due to these skills, I expect I will have a higher chance of both landing a job and maintaining one over long term times (>3 years).

# Weekly Reports

## Week 1 - 24/09/2018
This week I had to find a team to work with for the final year project. Fortunately Gareth approached me with the proposal of forming the 'Agency' which, instead of working on one final year game, we would work on freelance jobs given by people from outside the university.
I am in a team that consists of about 8 BSc programmers and 8 BA students.
Everything feels like it's going to run a lot smoother this term, relative to my previous experiences.

## Week 2 - 01/10/2018
Nothing is really happening with the agency yet, waiting on Gareth for advice on how we should proceed with the assignment set about pointers. Shifting my focus onto my dissertation question and de-making a NES game. My dissertation will certainly be focused around taking a real life situation and trying to replicate it in a game, I am just unsure what I want to do it on currently. 
There have been a few arguments between us, the BSc, and the others in the group in the agency but hopefully this will get sorted out in the coming weeks.

## Week 3 - 08/10/2018
Still not much happening with anything, the same can be said with my motivation and work input.
Aside from the NES de-make presentation this week, I have decided to de-make the Nazi Zombies game mode from Call Of Duty, aptly named 'NESi Zombies'. The presentation went well, I think, I felt confident delivering the pitch to the rest of the group. Presentations have never really been a big issue of mine.

## Week 4 - 15/10/2018
Felt like the workload given to us has suddenly shot up in this week.
We have been set the task of designing a JavaScript prototype and hosting it on a website as part of our portfolio. I've never used JavaScript and I have forgotten how to host something on a server for a website, but I will look up online tutorials and hopefully it will soon become clear. 
We were also introduced to 6502 coding this week which, in my opinion, is a completely absurd and ludicrous language. I'll go through Ed's videos slowly one-by-one but I'm not confident that even after doing this, I will understand.
The agency has also been split, the BA students decided that they were unhappy with their decision to not work on a game and have all left to create a game. With 2 BSc programmers also leaving this has put the number of people in the agency at 6.
Because of the number being so low, Gareth has had to make changes to what we are going to be doing in the Agency which we will be informed about in the coming weeks.

## Week 5 - 22/10/2018
I've been working flat-out on the JavaScript and 6502 projects in hopes that if I throw enough time at them, I will eventually understand how to apply my brain power to accomplishing these headaches of tasks. The 6502 has less priority because I have video tutorials from Ed on how to do them, so I feel as though they will be easier to follow. JavaScript is not my favourite thing in the world right now, I'm trying to create a game that mimics the classic Snake game which will be shown on a webpage. So far this task is not going well, the snake also has an interesting bug where it will travel in the opposite direction of the command given to it, will have to investigate further.

## Week 6 - 29/10/2018
To be honest, I haven't been working much recently and for the first time in my university life this was not because of anxiety or other life stress; it was because I'm being lazy. I feel mentally fatigued already, even though I'm only 6 weeks in, I need to start getting a plan of action sorted out. I have a slap-dash attempt at the JavaScript game which I'm not proud of, but will hopefully pass. The product created for the JavaScript assignment is a perfect representation of my effort put into this term so far; this is not okay.
I'm going to meet with my student mentor, Charlotte, to discuss how to counter this frame of mind.

## Week 7 - 05/11/2018
Of course I managed to miss the meeting with Charlotte and am now unable to meet with her till next term. Nothing to be done about that now though, I just need to keep up the momentum I'm gathering and hopefully not crash before I reach Christmas. I have completely neglected my dissertation which came back to bite me as we had to present our findings this week and answer questions about our dissertation proposal. Fortunately, I think I managed to just slip through by the skin of my teeth. This was, I believe, due to my ability to remain calm during a presentation and just let my mind speak clearly. I hope that's what came across, anyway. 
With the presentation out of the way I made a last ditch effort to complete the JavaScript game and hand it in, not proud of it, but it is done.

## Week 8 - 12/11/2018
The amount of hours put into working continues to rise as I manage to get a hold of the elusive concept of motivation again. With the peer review coming up in this week I had to cram work into a small window and get 752 words done in order to have something presentable at the peer review. My method of working has been to have the entire day for myself and doing what I want, then once everyone has gone to sleep (around 12, midnight), I start working on assignments. This sounds like I don't give myself a lot of time to work, but this is usually when I'm least anxious and also have the least amount of things which can possibly distract me (everyone sleeps at night, surprisingly and therefore don't disturb me). I work for around 3 hours a night in which I manage to get 9-day hours worth of work done.

## Week 9 - 19/11/2018
Seems to me that I have a small window for a breather this week, I spent the week working on my dissertation and the agency projects.
Managed to raise my dissertation word count to 1700 and helped create the mobile application for doctors to monitor their patients on a mobile application, in Unity. Rate of progress is continuing to go up as we reach the end of term 1.

## Week 10 - 26/11/2018
I fear I may not be able to reach 6000 words or 6 pages of dissertation work by the end of term one and am therefore going to apply for an EC (Extenuating Circumstances) citing my change in medication as the reason for my lack of work from weeks 1-7. Whether or not the medication was the legitimate reason for my low-energy mood, or if I was just being lazy, is unknown but also irrelevant from my point of view as it is in the past and cannot be changed. Handed in the NES game, I'm not happy with this outcome either but I will try to keep moving forward.

## Week 11 - 03/12/2018
This week I finished creating the sendEmail function for the self-harm application. This takes the information from the database and sends it to the user as an email. This will be useful for doctors when they wish to transfer the information onto their computers for easier reading and easier integration with their systems. My EC still has not come through and I've heard others have received their ECs after only two days, this is concerning. 

## Week 12 - 10/12/2018
The EC is still in the process of being accepted, unfortunately I have gone past the point of the deadline and need to cram work into getting my dissertation done. I have 3 days to write roughly 4300 words and cite at least 15 more sources. Due to this I have not done 
anything else this week.
